# Optical Illusion in VLM
---
### üìã Overview
This project investigates the fascinating intersection of computer vision and cognitive psychology by testing how advanced MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) interpret optical illusions. We compare multiple cutting-edge models to understand their visual perception capabilities and limitations.
